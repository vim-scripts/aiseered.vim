(For those who are interested: "aiSee" is a trade mark which is expected to be pronounced "I see".)

I find this scheme quite pleasant -- even though any red, including dark red, is always said to be a bad choice for a background.

Anyway, I'm not selling a pig in a poke here: http://www.aisee.com/aiseered.png

I've written the scheme especially for working with files in GDL/VCG format (hence the naming), and it goes well together with vimscript #706. It also works quite fine for C/C++ and I've heard of people using it for editing Ruby. However, I wouldn't recommend using it for editing HTML if you do care for your eyes.

aiseered was tested with gVim 6.2 under Windows 2000 and with gVim 6.3 under Ubuntu Linux.

Your feedback is appreciated.
